## What is Lit?
Lit is an anonymous image sharing app designed to showcase events near you, in the form of pictures.

## How do I use Lit?
You can browse photos a few different ways. On Lit, users post images, and can see images posted by others close to them. Users may look at images being posted at nearby events, or anywhere there is a large concentration of images being posted. Also, users can look at new photos being posted near them, or popular or "lit" photos posted in their area. Users can either upvote or downvote a photo that they see, or do neither. In the "Lit" section, the photos are sorted by their difference of upvotes and downvotes, while in the "New" section, the most recently taken photos are shown first.

Users can also anonymously comment on photos, and these comments can also be voted on and sorted.
