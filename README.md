## What is Lit?
Lit is an anonymous image sharing app designed to showcase events near you, in the form of pictures.

## How do I use Lit?
You can browse photos a few different ways. 
In Lit users post images, and can see images posted by others close to them.  Users may also look at images being posted at events, or where there is a large concentration of images being posted.  Users can look at new photos being posted near them, popular or 'Lit' photos being posted near them, and also photos being posted in large concentration, like at an event.  Additionally based on a users location, a user can also view all of the photos posted of where he/she was when he/she was there in a given night.  The user will recieve a notification telling them that all of the images from their night have been collected and can be viewed.
